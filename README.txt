Goal: Improve run-time for phase symmetry, which localizes the bone surface within noisy 3D ultrasound (US) images. Real-time phase symmetry is needed, if US is to replace CT scans in some clinical applications.

Time reduction was achieved by rewriting the code in C++, optimizing the code and using GPUs
